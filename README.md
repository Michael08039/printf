ALX PRINTF PROJECT:Replicating a custom printf function in C

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This project aims to implement a custom version of the `printf` function in the C programming language. The custom `printf` function, named `_printf`, allows users to print formatted output to the standard output (stdout) with support for various format specifiers, flags, width, precision, and custom conversion specifiers. The project leverages the power of variadic functions and string manipulation to handle different data types and format the output according to the specified format string. The custom `printf` function is designed to closely resemble the behavior of the standard `printf` function while providing additional features like custom conversion specifiers for reversing strings and ROT13 encoding. The project adheres to the Betty coding style guidelines to ensure clean and readable code. Comprehensive testing is performed to verify the correctness and robustness of the implementation across various scenarios and edge cases. Overall, the project aims to provide a versatile and efficient custom `printf` function that can be used as an alternative to the standard `printf` function in C projects.
